    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocess** - You'll convert text to sequence of integers.\n",
    "- **Models** Create models which accepts a sequence of integers as input and returns a probability distribution over possible translations. After learning about the basic types of neural networks that are often used for machine translation, you will engage in your own investigations, to design your own model!\n",
    "- **Prediction** Run the model on English text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "We begin by investigating the dataset that will be used to train and evaluate your pipeline.  The most common datasets used for machine translation are from [WMT](http://www.statmt.org/).  However, that will take a long time to train a neural network on.  We'll be using a dataset we created for this project that contains a small vocabulary.  You'll be able to train your model in a reasonable time with this dataset.\n",
    "### Load Data\n",
    "The data is located in `data/small_vocab_en` and `data/small_vocab_fr`. The `small_vocab_en` file contains English sentences with their French translations in the `small_vocab_fr` file. Load the English and French data from these files from running the cell below."
